**JustifAI** is your personal AI assistant for crafting the perfect excuse or apology, complete with digital "proofs" to back up your story.

This isn't just a text generator; it's a sophisticated tool that leverages a fine-tuned language model to create context-aware, plausible responses and generates supporting evidence like fake WhatsApp screenshots and voice notes.

### ✨ Core Features

*   **🧠 Intelligent Generation**: Uses a PEFT-fine-tuned model based on `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` for high-quality, context-aware excuses and apologies.
*   **📝 Customizable Input**: Tailor your message by specifying the situation, priority, plausibility, and additional context.
*   **🔬 Multi-Format Proofs**:
    *   **📱 WhatsApp Screenshot**: Generates a realistic WhatsApp screenshot of your excuse and a random reply.
    *   **🎤 Voice Note**: Creates an MP3 voice note of the generated message using text-to-speech.
    *   **📍 Location Context**: The AI suggests a plausible location-based scenario to support your story.
*   **💡 Adaptive Suggestions**: Learns from your feedback! Previously rated excuses are suggested for similar future situations.
*   **📜 History & Feedback**: All generations are saved in a history log where you can rate their effectiveness and mark favorites.
*   **📁 Data Management**: Easily load your own excuse/apology datasets and save/load your generation history.

### 🤖 The AI Model

The core of JustifAI is powered by one of the leading open-source language models, enhanced with custom fine-tuning.

*   **Base Model**: **[`mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)**, chosen for its exceptional balance of performance and efficiency.
*   **Customization**: **PEFT Fine-Tuning** adapters are loaded on top of the base model. This means the model has been further trained on a specialized dataset, honing its ability to match the required tone and context with great accuracy.
